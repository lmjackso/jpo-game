                  <p class="lead">
                    You represent company X, a leader in consumer electronics and innovator in technology. Your company has just signed a contract to
                    participate in a joint program to create the base chip for the next generation of mobile devices. Prior to the signing of the contract,
                    your company has allocated $4 million for the development and manufacture of this new chip and $1 million in case of emergency to
                    necessarily meet all the requirements for the product by deadline. The chip will be extremely expensive to develop on your own, but
                    it is integral in the technology of tomorrow. Other companies invested in the development of the same chip have agreed to equally
                    share the cost of development with you in a joint program, so everyone will save a lot of money and estimated to spend no more than a
                    quarter ($1 million) of what they originally intend on spending for the chip ($4 million), had it been a private effort.

                  <p class="lead">
                    You are given $4 million plus $1 million emergency money to complete production of the chip and deliver all its base plus added
                    custom features to the market by the end of the game.

                  <p class="lead">
                    As a stakeholder, you have signed on to give your time and money in a joint effort with the other stakeholders to develop a set of
                    key features characteristic of the &quot;technology of tomorrow&quot;. To distinguish yourself from the other stakeholders, your competitors,
                    and to uphold your company's standard for elegance, innovation and reliability, your mobile product will feature some unique
                    capabilities that require additional hardware and sensors to be added to the chip. In addition, you have already started building
                    the software for your mobile devices on a hardware prototype and the software is created with these new hardware capabilities in mind.<br><br>
                    The joint program retains full intellectual ownership of the hardware until its completion date, in which intellectual ownership and
                    copies of the hardware will be relinquished to the stakeholders of the program for them to continue software-hardware integration,
                    packaging and mass production in their own perspective factories.

                  <p class="lead">
                    Other program stakeholders will attempt to also request additional features to the chip. Their requests do not usually overlap with
                    yours because their mobile devices will run with different operating systems. You also have different business mottos. While you
                    care about quality and expandability, they care about affordability and mass marketing. You also heard rumors that some of the other
                    stakeholders intend on using the chip in applications other than mobile devices, so their hardware requirements might be drastically
                    altered. Due to the existence of fierce competition in consumer electronics, you should assume that their custom feature requests never
                    overlap with yours.

                  <h3>Joint Program Manager</h3>
                  <p class="lead">
                    During the development stage, a joint program manager will be assigned to the program in order to ensure that expenditure in production
                    does not grossly exceed projected cost in the contract ($1 million from every stakeholder). He will also play the role of the thumb of
                    approval for new features to be added to the hardware. During each periodic peer review, the joint program manager will take
                    recommendations from the stakeholders for custom capabilities to be added to the chip. He will make the sound judgment and approve or
                    disapprove the new requests from one or multiple stakeholders. In order to be fair to all the stakeholders and impartial in the
                    decision-making, the joint program manager will not consider custom features on a case-by-case basis or subjectively in its potential
                    value to the consumers or stakeholders.  Rather, he will consider each custom feature solely based on its implementation feasibility and
                    integration potential with the base chip, i.e. time and cost to integrate it into the development of the base chip. This abstract notion
                    of implementation feasibility will be measured in setback units (su). Requests with low su will be prioritized over requests with high
                    units, because it has less of a potential to produce a setback for the program, i.e. lead to the program to grossly exceed its predicted
                    expenditure.

                  <p class="lead">
                    Your job as a company representative is to ensure that your company's next generation mobile device receives all the capabilities
                    you advertised and is released within the constraint of $4 million (plus $1 million emergency) allocated fund.  Failure to complete
                    the chip within that constraint and/or failure to complete custom capabilities will cost your company loyalty from your customers and
                    credibility with your investors.  Excessive expenditure in the development of the chip will cost your company credibility with your
                    stockholders and investors. The deterioration of your company's reputation will be directly correlated to the amount you exceed your
                    expected release date and estimated cost.

                    The game ends when you deliver your product to the market. Upon release, you will be evaluated by both your customers and
                    investors/stockholders for the quality of your delivery and given a combined score. Your compensation for participating in
                    this game will be a scaled equivalent of that score.
